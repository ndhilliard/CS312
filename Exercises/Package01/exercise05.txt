1) if k >= d, then p(n) = O(n^k)

for large n ad*n^d is the biggest term in p(n)
if k>=d then n^d <= n^k

so p(n) is always less n or equal to constant times n^k
so for Big O, p(n) = O(n^k)

2) if k <= d then p(n) = omega(n^k)

because ad*n^d is positive and the largest term should be p(n) should at least be ad*n^d
if k <= d then n^k <=n^d
so p(n) is always greater than or equal to a constant times n^k
so big O p(n) = omega(n^k)

3) if k = d then p(n) = Theta(n^k)
from statement one when k = d then p(n) = O(n^k)
and from question 2 when k =d p(n) = omega (n^k)
since both are O(n^k) and omega(n^k) that means p(n) = Theta(n^k)

4 if k > d then p(n) o(n^k)
p(n)/n^k
since k > d exponent is negative
as n grows the terms go to 0
so ratio goes to 0
so then little o p(n) = o(n^k)

5 k < d then p(n)=omega(n^k)
one term becomes ad*n^(d-k)
since k < d the exponent is positive
so ad*n^(d-k) grows infinitely large
so omega p(n)=omega(n^k)
